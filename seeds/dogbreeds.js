The blackening around the muzzle points up the expression of keen watchfulness shining from the dark almond-shaped eyes. The Belgian Laekenois is protective of his master and property. Although observant with strangers the breed is affectionate and friendly with those he knows well.

Their dark black coats feature handsome squirrel-red accents including the red feet that give the breed its French nickname Bas-Rouge ('red stockings'). They're also seen in a black-gray-tan coat. The long head is well chiseled and the dark brown eyes project an expression breed fanciers describe as frank and confident.

They can almost read your mind and will lie in bed for hours without moving a muscle. They have almost no desire to go out and run around like regular dogs although they are athletic enough to jump surprisingly tall fences and compete in agility. Chinese Cresteds are not gregarious but they are intensely social and bond quickly within their pack. They donâ€™t accept strangers easily. Once it falls in love with you youâ€™ll have a little stalker on your hands â€” heâ€™ll be eternally thoroughly devoted.",

Always on the lookout for a good time heâ€™ll make you laugh while he entertains himself. Heâ€™s friendly and happy with a lively nature that endears him to everyone (except small rodents) especially when he cocks his head to the side and looks at you quizzically.",
