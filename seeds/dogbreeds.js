Their dark black coats feature handsome squirrel-red accents including the red feet that give the breed its French nickname Bas-Rouge ('red stockings'). They're also seen in a black-gray-tan coat. The long head is well chiseled and the dark brown eyes project an expression breed fanciers describe as frank and confident. They're not for novice owners who might end up being owned by their dominant dog instead of the other way around.

Apartment dwellers can also enjoy this breed, provided they can give their dogs plenty of exercise and walks. These pups get along with just about everybody!",
