## Description

Covid-19 changed the way American's have lived their lives. In fact, pet adoptions increased by 30 to 40 percent in the year 2020 when compared to 2019. Unfortunately, by the following year, pet surrenders were up by 80%. Adopting a animal is a large responsibility that often times people are not prepared for. This application's purpose is to create a database on pet ownership and descriptions of various animals in order for the user to make a more informed decisions on future pet adoptions or integrating the user's pet into their daily activities.

## Goals

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished User Interface.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Implementation

![git branching](./images/git-branching.png)

* First, In order to implement development of creating a database of pets we utilized git branching. Git branching allows each programmer to work in a local branch. When the user pushes their work to the repository. The changes are peer reviewed to make sure that none of the upcoming changes will effect main branch. This also allows for user communication to see the progress of each user. If a change is submitted that will cause a merge conflict github will protect the main repository by making sure some changes are not committed. Github also allows issues to be assigned to other group members and allows others to assign tast so bugs can be worked and task are not being worked on in two different branches this helps to resolve any potential merge conflicts.

* Next, We installed the npm framework package of node and express.js. With express, we have a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware to create a RESTful API. When working with Express we are able to use Routing, Middleware and Request/Response. The methods we used in our project are app.get, app.use, req, and res to send information around the server.

* In order to connect our information to HTML we used Handlebars templating language. This allowed for fast design of the HTML page. Handlebars allows the web developer utilize the front end template to connect to the backend database. This gave us a spot to export our data onto the webpage that had been sequalized into mySQL.
  
![mysql](./images/mysql.png) ![sequelize](./images/sequelize.png)

* In order to connect to our database we used the npm package sequelize. This allowed us to seed our data into the sql table database. 

## Usage

  Build a db that is user friendly

## Installation
  
  npm i  

## Test

## Problems

  We weren't able to find a api that had the information we were looking for so we had to manually input each line of the database from pet websites in order to use the data we need to create the correct
