## Description

Covid-19 changed the way American's have lived their lives. In fact, pet adoptions increased by 30 to 40 percent in the year 2020 when compared to 2019. Unfortunately, by the following year, pet surrenders were up by 80%. Adopting a animal is a large responsibility that often times people are not prepared for. This application's purpose is to create a database on pet ownership and descriptions of various animals in order for the user to make a more informed decisions on future pet adoptions or integrating the user's pet into their daily activities.
